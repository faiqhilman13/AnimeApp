## Features in Detail

### Instant Search
The search bar implements debounced instant search with a 250ms delay. As you type, the app automatically searches the Jikan API and displays results in real-time. Previous requests are automatically cancelled to prevent race conditions.

### Pagination
Server-side pagination allows you to browse through thousands of anime. The pagination component shows page numbers with ellipsis for large page counts and includes previous/next buttons.

### Anime Details
Click on any anime card to view comprehensive details including:
- High-quality poster image with cinematic hero banner
- Title (English, Japanese, and romanized)
- Score, type, status, and rating
- Episode count, duration, and season
- Studios and genres
- Full synopsis and background information

### Error Handling
The app gracefully handles various error scenarios:
- Network failures with clear error messages
- API rate limiting (429 errors)
- Invalid API responses
- Anime not found (404 errors)
- Request timeouts

### Mobile Responsive
The app is fully responsive with breakpoints for:
- Mobile (< 768px): Single column layout
- Tablet (768px - 1024px): 2-3 column grid
- Desktop (> 1024px): 4 column grid

## Design Philosophy

The app's design is inspired by the golden age of anime (1980-1990s) with particular influence from:

- **Cowboy Bebop**: Jazz-inspired color palette, deep blues and warm oranges
- **Samurai Champloo**: Retro-futuristic aesthetic, hip-hop influenced design
- **VHS Era**: Film grain texture, scan line effects
- **Neon Tokyo**: Glowing effects, vibrant accent colors

The theme combines nostalgia with modern usability, creating a unique and memorable user experience.

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive unit tests for:
- Custom hooks (useDebounce)
- Redux slices (searchSlice, animeDetailSlice)
- Component rendering and interactions

Run tests with:
```bash
npm test          # Watch mode
npm run test:run  # Single run
```

## API

This project uses the [Jikan API](https://docs.api.jikan.moe/) (v4), a free unofficial MyAnimeList API. No authentication is required.

Key endpoints used:
- `/anime` - Search anime with pagination
- `/anime/{id}` - Get detailed anime information
- `/top/anime` - Get top-rated anime

## Browser Support

- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)

## Deployment

The app can be deployed to any static hosting service. Recommended platforms:
- **Netlify** (recommended, free tier available)
- Vercel
- GitHub Pages
- Render

### Deploy to Netlify

1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Deploy the `dist` folder to Netlify
3. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`

## Performance

- **Bundle Size**: Optimized with Vite's tree-shaking and code splitting
- **API Calls**: Debounced and cancellable to minimize unnecessary requests
